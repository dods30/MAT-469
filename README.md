# Course Syllabus: Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering

## Course Description

This course introduces Monte Carlo methods/simulations with a focus on applications in financial risk management and actuarial science. It covers the basics, including pseudorandom number generators, non-uniform distributions, and option pricing. This repository is a collection of in-class labs, homework and the final project I will have worked on.
