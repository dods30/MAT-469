## (1): run a ton of simulations of the game and then count number of times the player wins by switching divide by the count of total number of simulations 

## (2): P y = 1 

## (3): 
```{r}
n = 10000

# Function to simulate one game
simulate_game <- function() {
  doors = c("car", "goat", "goat")
  car_door = sample(1:3, 1)  # Randomly pick a door for the car
  player_choice = sample(1:3, 1)  # Player randomly picks a door
  
  if (doors[player_choice] == "car") {
    # If the player initially chooses the door with the car,
    # the host randomly opens one of the other two doors with a goat
    host_choice = sample(setdiff(1:3, player_choice), 1)
  } else {
    # If the player initially chooses a door with a goat,
    # the host opens the other door with a goat
    host_choice = setdiff(which(doors == "goat"), player_choice)
  }
  
  # The player switches the choice of the door
  switch_choice = setdiff(1:3, c(player_choice, host_choice))
  
  # Return 1 if the player's final choice is the car, 0 otherwise
  ifelse(doors[switch_choice] == "car", 1, 0)
}
```

## (4): 
```{r}
# Simulate n games and estimate the probability of winning
results <- replicate(n, simulate_game())
p_hat <- mean(results)
se <- sd(results) / sqrt(n)
ci_lower <- p_hat - qnorm(0.995) * se
ci_upper <- p_hat + qnorm(0.995) * se

cat("Estimated probability of winning if the player switches:", p_hat, "\n")
cat("99% Confidence Interval: [", ci_lower, ",", ci_upper, "]\n")

```

## (5): Since the claimed probability of 2/3 (0.6667) falls within the 99% confidence interval [0.6478983, 0.6723017], we can conclude that the simulation results support Vos Savant's claim

## (6) use replicate function instead
